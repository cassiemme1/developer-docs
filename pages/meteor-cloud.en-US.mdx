# Meteor Cloud

Meteor Cloud is a decentralized, user-centric storage fully controlled by wallet.
It is an encrypted personal cloud to store your internet footprints - creations, interests, contribution, social interactions, and more.
It visualizes your data as files and monetize them as on-chain assets.

## Self-Sovereignty

Traditional clouds store their data on centralized servers, which is lack of transparency and sovereignty. To address this, Meteor Cloud utilizes DataverseOS to manage decentralized data networks, ensuring users have true ownership over personal data.
Specifically, data is encrypted before sending to servers, and only users can decrypt with wallet-based authentication.
Data sovereignty is also reflected in following aspects:

1. User decides who can access specific data in the encrypted cloud
2. User can profit from data instead of big companies profiting from it.

## Hyper storage over applications

Meteor Cloud is more than storage, it is also an open platform for application development.
With our SDKs, everyone can build user-centric applications to access capabilities of this secure, shared, self-sovereign cloud space.
For example, a social app can store user profiles, social relationships, social content, etc.
While a note-taking tool can choose to save articles to Meteor Cloud.
**One application, One dropbox.**

For users, all the data generated from interacting with different applications will be aggregated in their own encrypted data space,
no longer scattered across centralized companies' servers like isolated data islands as in the Web2 internet.
Meteor Cloud stores all of a user's data in one place, helping users reclaim ownership and value of their online data.
At the same time, as a common data layer connecting thousands of applications, it provides interoperability between application data, under the premise of system security guarantees and user informed consent authorization.

Just like _Google Drive_ powers _Google Meet_, _Google Docs_ and other Google suite apps, where you can conveniently save recorded videos from Meet or documents from Docs to Drive,
Meteor Cloud will also provide users with a seamless experience of effortlessly commanding their data.
The difference is _Google Drive_ is closed and centralized, while Meteor Cloud will be open and decentralized.

## File sharing & monetization

Meteor Cloud provides programmable file sharing and access control.
Users can customize file accesses, such as setting whitelists or issuing NFT access tokens.
Developers can apply arbitrary smart contract based access control conditions over encrypted files.
Anyone who satisfies the conditions can fetch the decryption key shares from DKMS (e.g. Lit Protocol), then access the file content.

This mechanism also enables flexible data monetization, allowing users to sell personal data and contents for profits.
Developers can build data marketplaces, tokenized social networks or content platforms on top of it, such as Web3 versions of OnlyFans, Substack etc.
