# Meteor Wallet

[Meteor Wallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/meteor/kcigpjcafekokoclamfendmaapcljead) is a web3 wallet that manages both your financial assets and personal data.

It is not a wallet for cryptocurrency, but a data wallet where you can store, visualize and mange your online data in a decentralized manner.

The wallet acts as a gateway to DataverseOS-powered dApps. It ensures cross-app data security and prevents malicious apps from tampering users' data without consent.

Meteor also provides system calls for developers to build data dapps upon various data layers. There are three types of data wallets to integrate - they are Meteor Extension, Meteor Snap and Meteor Web (self-custody, where OS client is running inside the iframe).

## 3 ways to sign in

Meteor wallet enables 3 methods to sign in with your wallet address. They are `Sign-In with Extension`, `Sign-In with Snap`, and `Sign-In with Web`.

### Browser extension

Meteor lives as a browser extension like other crypto wallets. This is the most secure way to sign in with your wallet, for all keys, signatures, and credentials are encrypted and stored locally in your browser.

### MetaMask snap

Meteor also runs in your MetaMask as a snap. After installation, you can directly access your data wallet via MetaMask.

### Web

Web auth is the most seemless & smooth way to sign in. When signing in, an isolated iframe generates a keypair with 128 bits of entropy chosen at random, and the private key is never persisted anywhere so only the user can access it.

## Secure resources

We build Meteor wallet with the latest Ethereum Improvement Proposals, including Sign-in-with-Ethereum (SIWE, EIP4361) and Object Capability (ReCaps, EIP-5573). It implements safe, fine-grained resource control.

Sign-In with Ethereum (SIWE) defines how users can create decentralized identities and authenticate with off-chain applications.

ReCaps extends Sign-In with Ethereum's functionality, enabling users to grant informed consent to applications to act on their behalf after signing in.

By combining these two standards, Meteor Wallet enables users to selectively delegate permissions for applications to handle some of their resources.
This is done by signing messages that inform the user exactly what access they are granting.
