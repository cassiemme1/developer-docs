# Meteor Wallet

[Meteor Wallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/meteor/kcigpjcafekokoclamfendmaapcljead) is a web3 crypto wallet that manages both your finances and personal data.

It is a fully-featured cryptocurrency wallet with additional functionality. Beyond sending transactions, NFTs, interacting with DeFi, etc. you can also create, visualize, and manage your DATA in a decentralized manner.

The wallet acts as a gateway to decentralized data applications (dApps). It prevents malicious applications from stealing your personal data without your consent.

The wallet is designed to protect user signatures and resources authenticated via Sign-In with Ethereum (SIWE).

## Secure resources

Meteor Wallet implements safe access controls for resources based on Ethereum Improvement Proposals EIP-4361 (Sign-In with Ethereum) and EIP-5573 (ReCaps).

Sign-In with Ethereum (SIWE) defines how users can create decentralized identities and authenticate with off-chain applications.

ReCaps extends Sign-In with Ethereum's functionality, enabling users to grant informed consent to applications to act on their behalf after signing in.

By combining these two standards, Meteor Wallet enables users to selectively delegate permissions for applications to handle some of their resources.
This is done by signing messages that inform the user exactly what access they are granting.

</div>

Signed messages (signatures) serve as credentials that grant access to resources.
The security of the signature is equivalent to the security of personal data.
If a user's signatures leak or are compromised, it poses a risk of their web3 resources being stolen or tampered with.
For example, if an unauthorized party gains access to a user's signatures, they could steal, edit or delete a user's personal data.

Meteor Wallet mitigates this risk by storing & protecting user's signatures locally like How MetaMask protects user private key,
and selectively denying access to view or export signatures.

We create Meteor Wallet in purpose to shape a standard for maintaining signature security in a decentralized manner.
We are committed to bringing this security layer to all traditional crypto wallets, making data security a necessary part of wallet services.
Thus users stay in control of their resources while being able to safely leverage decentralized apps.

## 3 ways to sign in

Meteor wallet enables 3 methods to sign in with your wallet address. They are `Sign-In with Extension`, `Sign-In with Snap`, and `Sign-In with Web`.

### Browser extension

Meteor lives as a browser extension like other crypto wallets. This is the most secure way to sign in with your wallet, for all keys, signatures, and credentials are encrypted and stored locally in your browser.

### MetaMask snap

Meteor also runs in your MetaMask as a snap. After installation, you can directly access your data wallet via MetaMask.

### Web

Web auth is the most seemless & smooth way to sign in. When signing in, an isolated iframe generates a keypair with 128 bits of entropy chosen at random, and the private key is never persisted anywhere so only the user can access it.
