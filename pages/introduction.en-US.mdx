# What is Meteor?

Meteor is a web3 personal cloud controlled by your wallet. Its core is an Internet Data Operating System called [DataverseOS](https://dataverse-os.com/), which manages online data for users and fosters development of self-sovereign data applications.

Meteor runs on top of several decentralized stacks. It is built for reshaping today's internet and bringing a new data paradigm - data stored in personal cloud, encrypted with wallets, computed by dApps and monetized with smart contracts.

Meteor is the super app for internet users: it not only stores data but also incentivizes data production, which powers the data economy.

## The OS composition

Meteor is composed of 3 components, which are:

- **Meteor Cloud** - User-centric storage fully owned by you. A cloud drive to store, visualize and monetize all data assets.

- **Meteor Wallet** - A crypto wallet managing both token & data assets.
- **DApp Store** - A secure, open, and innovative platform to discover and experience the latest decentralized applications.
