# What is Meteor?

Meteor is the next-generation personal computer owned by your wallet. The core is an Internet Data Operating System called [DataverseOS](https://dataverse-os.com/), which manages online data for users and eases development of self-sovereign data applications.

Meteor Computer is running on top of decentralized stacks, serving as the portal to web3. It is built for reshaping today's internet and bringing a new data paradigm - data stored in personal cloud, encrypted with wallets, computed by dApps and monetized using smart contracts.

Meteor is the super app for consumers: not only stores data but also incentivizes the production of data, and powers the data economy.

## The OS composition

Meteor is composed of 3 high-level components, which are:

- **Meteor Cloud** - User-centric storage fully owned by your identity. A cloud drive to store, visualize and monetize all data assets.

- **Meteor Wallet** - A crypto wallet managing both token & data assets.
- **DApp Store** - A secure, open, and innovative platform to discover and experience the latest decentralized applications.
