# What is Meteor?

## Overview

Meteor is a web3 personal data management system. The core is an Internet Data Operating System called [DataverseOS](https://dataverse-os.com/), which manages online data for users and eases development of self-sovereign data applications.

Meteor provides wallet-controlled data storage, data monetization, and decentralized application (DApp) discovery. It is a user-centric data management system that allows users to store, visualize, and monetize all data assets.

## The OS composition

Meteor is composed of 3 high-level components, which are:

- **Meteor Cloud** - User-centric storage fully owned by your identity. A cloud drive to store, visualize and monetize all data assets.

- **Meteor Wallet** - A crypto wallet managing both token & data assets.
- **DApp Store** - A secure, open, and innovative platform to discover and experience the latest decentralized applications.
